# Ye's Grind

This repository contains a modified version of retro (90's era DOS) DOOM that Iâ€™m currently developing. This repository is used for staging an image for web hosting purposes. It is marked as public to comply with software licensing requirements.

Find me on x.com at [@Ye_Grind](https://x.com/Ye_Grind).

See this game in action at [https://yegrind.rodeo](https://yegrind.rodeo).

## Features
- Integration of a modified DOOM engine (`DOOM.EXE`) and Freedoom-based WAD file tailored for this project.
- A modified version of [js-dos](https://github.com/caiiiycuk/js-dos) specifically for my use case.
- I don't suggest forking this project. If you want to get started with running DOS games in a browser, use a fresh clone of [js-dos](https://github.com/caiiiycuk/js-dos) as my changes are very use case specific. js-dos plays many retro DOS games out of the box beautifully with no modifications needed!

## ðŸŽ“ Credits
- Core web-based DOS emulation powered by [js-dos](https://github.com/caiiiycuk/js-dos) (MIT License).
- `DOOM.EXE` is a customized build based on:
  - The original DOOM Source Code by id Software (GPL v2.0)
  - MBF (Marine's Best Friend) by Killough
  - mbf_sigil by Sakitoshi
- Base assets are from the [Freedoom project](https://freedoom.github.io/) (CC0 / BSD Licenses).
- Custom assets were generated almost entirely by [OpenAI's Sora](https://openai.com/sora/). Some of them took many iterations. Tech tip: swearing at Sora does not help, I tried.
- Custom DOOM wad file was assembled using [Slade3](https://slade.mancubus.net).
