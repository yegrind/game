## ðŸš€ Features
- Custom integration of a modified DOOM engine (`DOOM.EXE`) executed via js-dos.
- Includes a Freedoom-based WAD file tailored for this project.
- Prototype-level implementation focused on my specific use case.
- Expect rough edges â€” this is a work in progress, evolving step by step.
